      <p>
        Oman PCC verification involves obtaining a Police Clearance Certificate
        from the police or a relevant authority in the applicantâ€™s home country
        (India, in this case) and getting it verified for authenticity. This
        verification ensures that the document is recognized and accepted by the
        Omani authorities.
