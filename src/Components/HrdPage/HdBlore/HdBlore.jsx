      <p>
        If the document issued state is Karnataka, validation by Home Department
        Attestation in Bangalore is carried out by the SHD of Karnataka. The
        services of document attestation process the documents that were issued
        by the same state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our attestation services can deliver the SHD authentication for other
        states as well. There are 3 types of documents & all of them need a
        different type of specialization for authentication. SHD attestation is
        necessary for the personal certificate attestation process before
        getting legitimization from the embassy & even though the document is
        transmitting from Bangalore, the document obtains a Karnataka Home
        Department stamp.
