          various reasons such as which country you mandate the attestation for,
          or the types of documents, or the state you required it from. Usually,
          it will take about eight to ten days for completion. But it can still
          extend up to a couple of weeks more than a month for Educational
          Certificate apostille in Bangalore. The total time will still be
          affected by these mentioned reasons.
