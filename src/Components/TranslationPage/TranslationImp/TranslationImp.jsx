        Translation can bridge the linguistic gap between different languages,
        facilitating clear and effective communication. Diverse types of
        translations are required for various purposes, each needing specific
        expertise. For example, legal translations require an authorized
        translator. Goodway Attestation was established to overcome language
        barriers that might interfere with daily activities. We carefully
